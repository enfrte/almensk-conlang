# The guy and the cows.

Once upon a time, a guy took a shortcut across a falmers field.
He soon caught the attention of some cows. 
They caught up with guy and started to talk to him.
The guy ignored the cows and continued to walk.
But the cows continued to talk to the guy.
Finally, the guy said, I don't understand what you are saying. 
I'm not a cow, I'm a guy.
